# A* Pathfinding Algorithm 
This repository contains an implementation of the A* Pathfinding Algorithm, a widely-used search algorithm for finding the shortest path in a grid or maze. The project is optimized for performance using a priority queue and a heuristic function for efficient navigation.
## Features 
Optimized Performance:
- Time Complexity: O(E + V log V) using a Min-Heap (priority queue).
- Handles large grids efficiently with minimal redundant computations.

Customizable Heuristics:
- Supports Euclidean and Manhattan distance for flexible use cases.
Applications:
- Robotics navigation, game development, and AI systems.
## Under Construction!
Will be implementing more features to this application or is still under planning and development
